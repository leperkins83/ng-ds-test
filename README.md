Instructions: create a new repository called ng-ds-test.
Within this repo, create a README.md file. Copy and
paste all of these questions into this README file and
answer them.

Angular and Tree questions have been skipped.

1.Name and describe the two main operations of a
stack (to add and remove data).
a).push() adds value to the front of the stack
b).pop() removes value from the front and returns value
LIFO- Last item added or 'pushed' Into the stack will be
the First item removed or 'popped' Out of the stack


2.Name and describe the two main operations of a
queue (to add and remove data).
a)enqueue() adds value to the back of the queue
b)dequeue() removes value from front, returns value
FIFO- First item added or 'enqueued' Into the queue
will be the First item removed or 'dequeued' Out of
the queue

8.What are the four main steps of mergesort?
1.split the array in half, favor the right if array has an
uneven number of elements
2.mergesort the left half of the array
3.mergesort the right half of the array
4.rejoin the two halfs once sorting is complete

9.Say you have a program which handles the login queue to
a game server. The game server is able to log in one person
every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after
a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed
from the queue. Draw the state of the queue at 12:00:06,
considering the following sequence of events:

At 12:00:00 Hades logs in
At 12:00:00 Ares logs in
At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in
At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in
At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in
At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in
At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in
At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in.

Hades will be dequeued at 12:00:01
Ares will be dequeued at 12:00:02
Zeus will be dequeued at 12:00:03
Buzz will be dequeued at 12:00:04
Kanye West will be dequeued at 12:00:05

Taylor Swift will be dequeued at 12:00:06

Darkwing Duck will have to wait til 12:00:07 to be dequeued
Evil Mickey will be dequeued at 12:00:08
